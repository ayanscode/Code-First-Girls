                <h2>Eating healthy</h2>
                Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean buying the entire green section
                of Whole Foods. However,
                it is important that you eat a balanced diet for the sake of your health. Not only will you be fuelling your superiority complex by eating more
                greens, but you also will be getting your 5 a day. In addition, your body will thank you for taking the supplements to provide you with
                the vitamins it needs. <br><br>
                <i>Remember though, it's all about balance</i>.<p> Eating healthily should not be about limiting yourself.
                    By all means eat that chocolate bar or that 6pc chicken nugget meal. The main
                    thing is that you incorporate the necessary
                    components of the beloved eatwell plate. And that includes drinking enough water too.

                <h2>Physical Activity</h2>
                This can be in any form you like: go for a run, walk or jog. Do a yoga class, or maybe some gymnastics (be careful!)
                Ride a bike. Do a Chloe Ting Workout. Maybe you're not into the whole fit girl aesthetic. 
                That's perfectly fine! You could even dance to your favourite song and poorly attempt to copy the choreo.
                 So long as you get your heart pumping for 20-25 minutes a day :). 
                 <p>Physical activity is not just to attain whichever body goals you have, but it is a known fact that exercise
             causes your body to release <b>endorphins</b> as well as increase your <b>serotonin</b>  levels,
             boosting your mood. What's more, regular exercise can also help you to sleep better, reduce
             the chance of developing various health problems such as high blood pressure and stroke. It's a win win.

               <h2>practice good hygiene</h2>
                   <p> The content you've been waiting for. Find some soap you adore the smell of
                       and some exfoliants.Take extra care when you wash youur skin, imagine all the negativity
                       being washed away. Wash and detangle your hair Shave your legs, or don't, it's your choice :). Maybe if you're feeling
                       super boujee, try a face mask and read/watch a bit of
                       Netflix while you wait for it to dry. Just do something you enjoy, that's the main takeaway.
                        </p>

                               <li>3-5 drops of tea tree oil</li>
                               <li> a bit of water </li>

                    <h3>(bonus idea!) cuddle</h3>
                    Touch starvation is real guys. According to Google humans are supposed to get a minimum of 8
                    hugs a day. Get some oxytocin (another happy hormone btw) in your system and give someone a hug. Or invest in a pet, pets are really good
                    to cuddle where humans are low in stock. And if you cannot get a pet,
                    costco and ikea do really cute teddy bear plushies :)
