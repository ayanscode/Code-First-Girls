            Emotional self care is, in essence, being in touch with how we really feel. 
            It sounds really clich√© i know but in today's society it's really easy to bottle up our emotions -
            maybe because we don't want to be perceived as weak, 
            or because our life situation makes it unsafe to do so. <br>
            Let's get something clear:
            <br><br>
             <b>All emotions are valid. it is perfectly fine to feel how you feel.</b> 
             <br>
             <br>
             However, when we let our emotions build up, they manifest in ways that can harm yourself or others.
             Here are some basic tips on how to practice emotional self-care  
<br>

        <div style="float: right;">
            <div class="method1" style=" background-color: rgb(210, 210, 255);
            color: rgb(58, 41, 153);">
             <p><h2>allow yourself to feel</h2>
                 This is probably the most important tip. Find an outlet to express yourself truly.
                 Talk to a friend or a therapist. Cry it out. Take a walk to talk yourself (it works, trust me).
                 Scribble it out on a peice of paper and burn it, if you want.
                 <br>
                  <b>Get it out of your head and put it out into the open.</b>
                 <br>
                 Journalling is a particular good way to get your feelings out.
                 Even if there's no specifically traumatic event that has happened to you, you can use prompts to
                 discover more about yourself. <i>Here are a few prompt examples</i>:
                 <ul>
                     <li> What would an ideal day look like for you? </li>
                     <li>If you could, what would you tell your younger self?</li>
                     <li> What aspects of your personality do you like the most? Which ones do you dislike?</li>
                 </ul>
            
             </p>
            </div><img src="images/svg/diary.svg">
            <div class="clear"></div>
        </div>

        <div>
            <div class="method2" style=" background-color: rgb(225, 225, 255);
            color: rgb(58, 41, 153);">
                    <h2>set and REINFORCE boundaries</h2>
                    <p>
                        What are you tolerating that you feel that you shouldn't? As humans it's really easy to fall into
                        people pleasing habits. These can drain you even more, hence the importance of setting boundaries.
                        A key thing is also to remember <i>why</i> you set these boundaries in the first place.
                        Maybe you have unspoken rules for yourself that were established as a child. Knowing exactly why
                        you have a boundary in place makes it easier to enforce.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, setting and reaffirming the boundary is all well and good, but putting it into practice?
                        Not so much. <b>Get comfortable saying no</b> Learn to not be available for every work task. Cut off
                        that partner who berates you consistently. Maybe some will think you're prude or selfish,
                        but at the end of the day, someone else's perception
                        of you can not kill you. Prioritise yourself and your needs.          
                    </p>

               <h2>Take a break</h2>
               Schedule in some time to do something that you love. Have something to look forward to. Life is too
               short to not enjoy it.
               it's really easy to get overwhelmed with work and experience burnout. in the end, if you don't stop
               for this break you reduce your own productivity (shocking right?). So for the sake of not getting stressed
               out, take some time to do something you like. sleep, draw, organise your playlist collection. this doesn't even need to be everyday
               . you could even have a set day in the week for yourself.
               <p>On the subject of rest, <b>make sure you're getting 8 hours of sleep each day</b>! your body needs it. and lack of sleep
                   can lead to insomnia, high stress levels or depression. Put away your work, switch off from social
                   media and get some sleep.
