            Practicing self care for your mental wellbeing is essential: if you don't deal  with
            the issues in your head this can slowly influence your physical environment. This can become a vicious 
            cycle and lead to severe mental illnesses. Mental self care is a lot more than mindfulness and walks. 
            It takes strength and effort to take care of your mental, especially when it's so easy to lose yourself and
            hit a slump. Here are some ideas on how to practice self care to protect your mental wellbeing &heartsuit;
            <!--not that if you are severely mentally ill this may be hard to get done etc etc-->

                <h2>Clean out your space</h2>
             You may have heard it before, but having a cluttered workspace can take a toll on your mental.
             <br><br>
             <i>Clear space, clear mind</i>
             <p>
                 Make an effort to organise your space. Put away any files or items
                 you are not using in that present moment. You can always pick them out when you actually need them.
                 Pick those 3 day old coffee cups off your desk and wipe down your surfaces. Not only will you make your space
                 more visually pleasing, but you will also feel a sense of achievement! Just like when studies say making your bed
                 in the morning can boost your mood.
                <br><br>
            
                Cleaning your space doesn't even have to stop at your desk. Do you have any clothes you don't wear any more?
                Make some space in your closet!. Running out of file storage on your phone? Make a backup and delete any unused pictures
                and apps. Declutter your space and declutter your mind.

                <h2>Express gratitude</h2>
            Show some appreciation for what you have around you. 
            It's really easy to see the bad in everything, especially 
            with everything going on in the world. Sometimes it's helpful to take some time to appreciate what we have. Food, water
            sanitation, media, the ability to walk outside without living in absolute fear.
            <br><br> Capitalism today has continued to profit off the "human innate desire" to 
            continuously strive for more, convincing us that without clear skin or the latest phone or pair of trainers
            we will never truly be happy. Take a little time to write down a few things you're gratefull for, to help
            shift into a more positive mindset.

                <h2>Interact with other people</h2>
            A lot of the time our work or situations can consume us. Maybe you spend your time in 
            the workplace talking to people but not <i>talking</i> to people. Maybe you isolate yourself working on projects for 
            hours because it's due tomorrow. It happens to the best of us. 
            
            <p>Humans are supposed to be very social beings and meaningless conversations can be almost as draining as having no human 
                communication at all. Catch up with a friend or family member. Maybe ask how they're doing. Or meet up if you can. It
                may even be beneficial on both sides.
