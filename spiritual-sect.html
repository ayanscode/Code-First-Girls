            <p>Similar to your emotional health, your spiritual wellbeing can often be neglected as a repercussion of 
                the pressures of working of today. Religious or not, it's always good to tune in to your spiritual side. By 
                doing so, it may even be easier to handle turbulent situations and maintain peace when face to face with a storm.           </p>

                <h2>Engage with your spiritual beliefs</h2>
                Take some time to pray or interact with God. Take your stresses to Him.
                Thank Him for life and remember that He is in control of everything. Pray about any situations
                you're going through and ask for guidance. Find joy in the fact that God hears and answers prayers.
                <br><br>
                <i>nurturing your spirit does not necessarily mean talking to God, it can be anything
                    enabling you to develop a better understanding of yourself and the universe</i>.<br><br>
                If you're not religious, you can take some time to practice meditating. Be still
                and acknowledge your present reality. Analyse your thoughts, let them flow through
                you. <br>Once you've finished mediating, try to recall those thoughts. Is there anything
                about those thoughts that stop you from attaining the best version of yourself? Once those limiting
                ideologies have been detected, make a conscious effort to remind yourself
                that it's not true. For example, maybe you subconsciously think you're incapable of being loved. Affirm to yourself
                that you are worthy of love - out loud, on paper or however you want. Carry yourself accordingly.

                <h2>Be at one with Nature</h2>
                Pull away from your screen for some time and look at the beautiful world around you. Take a while to engage
                in the serenity, whether that means staying by a tree and watching the birds, or chilling by a lake.
                Maybe your environment doesn't have much green space.
                That's fine! Take a walk or explore your city to find a park somewhere, it will give you some alone time.
                  <br><br>
                A good thing about spending time in nature is that you do not need to actually <i> do</i> anything in that
                space. Relax. forget about the person who left you on delivered 3 weeks ago and watch some clouds. Acknowledge
                that you are here, in this world living. Make peace with your existence.

                <h2>Give back to the Community</h2>
                Make a positive impact in someone's life! Volunteer with an organisation, donate your
                money to a cause you believe in, spend some time with those less fortunate than yourself or volunteer.
                 If you believe in karma, this practice is really good for you but
                generally speaking, serving other people is just good for your self esteem as a whole.
                    <p><i>Do good, feel good. </i>
                    </p>
                <p>Another benefit of volunteering is 
                that you get to meet new people from various walks of life. This can open your eyes to 
                other perspectives on life, and maybe even aid your own pereption of life: what could be better than socialising whilst making
            a difference and being provided with a sense of purpose? </p>
